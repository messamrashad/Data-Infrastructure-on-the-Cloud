# Data-Infrastructure-on-the-Cloud
In this project, I will apply what i have learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, I need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.
